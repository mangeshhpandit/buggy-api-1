Problem statement

    The app when it comes up will have 2 users created in the system -
        user1@gmail.com with password user1ABC
        user2@gmail.com with password user2ABC

    user1@gmail.com cant login but user2@gmail.com can

    You can use the try it out feature on the swagger page with for the /login API to simulate this.Alternately you can use any choice of REST client for the same.

    The output expected out of this is as follows
        Debug why the login for user1@gmail.com fails.
        Once the bug is discovered fix it and submit the assignment via git


*****************************Solution*******************************

solution : Debug why the login for user1@gmail.com fails.

	when user login with above details error comes as
	"query did not return a unique result: 2; nested exception is javax.persistence.NonUniqueResultException: query did not return a unique result: 2",
  "path": "/user/login"  .."
                  
	this happen because in database there are 2 entries with sme name and same password
	
	if we remove duplicate entry form file db.changelog-1.0.xml then user can login successfully.
